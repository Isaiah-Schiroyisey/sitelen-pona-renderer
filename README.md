## Running
To be honest, I'm not sure what the easiest way to run this is. I just use VS Code and the Live Server extention, so here's how that works:
1. Download the files provided, making sure to store them all in one folder.
2. [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. In the Extentions tab in VS Code, search for "Live Server" and download it.
4. In VS Code, click "File" in the top-left.
5. Click "Open Folder".
6. Select the folder containing the downloaded files.
7. In the Explorer tab, right-click "ilo-pona.html".
8. Click "Open with Live Server". This should open a new tab with the website running.

## Usage
- Just type your text into the text box. Once you're done with a line, press the "pini e linja" button to confirm. Press the "open sin" button to reset.
- Click the Sun/Moon button to switch between light and dark mode.
