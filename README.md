## Running
I figured out how GitHub Pages works, so now all you have to do is go to [this website](https://isaiah-schiroyisey.github.io/sitelen-pona-renderer/)!

## Usage
- Just type your text into the text box. Once you're done with a line, press the "pini e linja" button to confirm. Press the "open sin" button to reset.
- Click the Sun/Moon button to switch between light and dark mode.
